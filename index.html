                          <p class="">The Winnipeg Sports App has been designed for hockey fans who wish to keep up with the Winnipeg Jets 
                            team. The application enables the users to stay up-to-date with the Winnipeg Jets games by keeping track of 
                            their current scores using the currently playing feature. In case they missed a game, they can simply use the 
                            same feature and by scrolling down, they can find the previously played games and their scores. Our users can 
                            also find the line ups of their teams by using the team rosters feature. The app also facilitates their task of 
                            finding player statistics. Our hockey enthusiasts will find more about specific players on a team using our player 
                            statistics feature which will display player quantifiable details for fans who want to know how times they have 
                            scored, assisted, etc. Fans can also check upcoming games using the schedule feature and if they wish to watch 
                            the live games, they can access the sports channels under our channel feature. We have created a news feed feature 
                            for the fans and whilst watching the live games, they can comment on the latest news about their hockey teams, 
                            leaving enough room for banter. The standing feature on the app will keep them updated about their teams’ overall
                             performance as it displays the standings of the NHL team in the current season. Lastly, the hockey enthusiasts will 
                             be able to connect to the broader community using the find nearby bars feature as they will be redirected to the 
                             locations where the games will be broadcasted on tv. 


                          </p>

                          <p>
                            The application serves as a platform for entertainment and social networking and it will benefit fans who love 
                            watching hockey. It will also enable fans to engage in conversations about live games and banter. Unlike other 
                            applications, which tend to focus more on various sports, our application is designed more for our hockey fans 
                            across Canada. With the range of data that the app offers, the hockey enthusiasts will be up-to-date about their
                             team’s performance, statistics and news. 

                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Our application hopes to serve those who wish to find more information about the ongoing game 
                            without needing to have several internet pages open. The live chat will also provide critical 
                            and live updates on the go to those who may not be able to watch the game. By having a live chat 
                            component as well as a bar and restaurant locator, our application will serve as an opportunity 
                            to connect local sports fans whether they gather in the live chat or at a bar or restaurant. 
                            Our application will be something people who used to live in Winnipeg can find useful, and a way 
                            for them to connect with others back home. In this present time during the pandemic and public 
                            restrictions, we hope that our application’s live chat component can be something our users will 
                            look forward to.

                    <p>
                      The application is considered a success based on three criteria. First, we want a million users worldwide 
                      in the first year that the application becomes available to users and generate a 10 million dollars revenue
                       within the same year. Secondly, we intend on receiving feedback from users who will complete a digital 
                       survey and compare their ease of accessing information about Winnipeg sports teams now to how they 
                       retrieved such information before our application was available to them. To conclude, we will compare 
                       the number of views Winnipeg games have had before and after our application became available to users. 
                       If any one of the criteria shows a significant improvement, without a statistically significant reduction 
                       in the other two, the application will be considered a success.

              <h1 class="text-center">Our Dev Experience</h1>
              <p>We were all terrified at the beginning of our project because all of us had little or no experience with most 
                of the tools required for implementation. We overcame our fear by leveraging team members’ technical and soft
                 skills to get our work started, we have an artist in our team who depicts all of our brainstorming sessions, 
                 verbal ideas into a meaningful visual representation that was developed into a 3-n tier architecture for each
                  iteration. </p>
              <p>
                We use just-in-time analysis, TDD techniques, and SOLID principles in our development process. 
                The just-in-time analysis gave us insights to add two new features (team schedule feature and standing feature)
                 as we realized we will not be able to completely implement the track live game feature and live chat feature 
                 we had planned to implement in iteration 0. Throughout the development process, we were all open to the feedback
                  and we applied lessons learned from the previous iteration to build a more stable codebase for our release. 
                  Being proactive, effective communication, and teamwork are skills we learned and applied to our development process,
                   which in turn result in the successful completion of our project. As a team of 5 students with no prior information 
                   about each other, we did great and we will not do anything differently. We were all committed from the beginning 
                   to the end. Ultimately, we delivered a better application, compared to our original plan. 

              </p>
              <h1 class="text-center">Project progress</h1>
              <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="./images/project-velocity.png">
              <p>
                In iteration 1, we planned to implement 3 different features but we implemented 2 features mainly because 
                this time in our development phase was a learning phase for all of us, we were just getting comfortable with 
                the required tools and techniques for our implementation. In iteration 2, we were more comfortable in our 
                expertise and time management which made us committed to more features (4 features), we successfully 
                released 3 features at the end of the iteration. In Iteration 3, we successfully implemented all remaining 
                features (4 features) to make our App ready for users by applying the instructor’s feedback, our technical 
                and soft skills, and good time management.
