                    <h3>What was the overall architecture of your system?</h3>
                    <p>Our architecture implements the 3-tier architecture design where we have 3 layers, the UI, the logic layer 
                      and the data layer. On iteration 3, we’ve managed to clean up a little bit of the hard coded material, relying 
                      more on actual data from the database, refactored the code and re-organized the structure of the classes and 
                      files.</p>

                    <h3>What went right in the development process? </h3>
                    <p>One thing that went right in the development process, is the successful implementation of both a real and fake 
                      database in our mobile application. During the initial project discussion, we decided to use an API to retrieve 
                      live data from a sports website but we weren’t quite successful there. We quickly resorted to using a real database, 
                      with updated data to display on the User Interface of different features. </p>

                  <div>
                    <h3>What went wrong in the development process? </h3>
                    <p>We were overly ambitious about having a live API working but it was a little bit to hard for us to figure out 
                      how to implement an API in our mobile application. This lead to a prudent technical debt as we had to discard a 
                      “Track Live Game” feature which required live data just to avoid dropping further features in case we were running 
                      out of time understanding how the API works. </p>

                    <h3>What would you do differently if you had the chance to start over?</h3>
                    <p>I would have certainly considered enriching my knowledge about APIs and how to integrate them into mobile 
                      application. It was only during the project iterations that we found that the API was a little bit overwhelming 
                      to understand and incorporate that into our program. I would have also committed to deliver more features as 
                      we fell short for the first iteration where our project velocity was a little bit low compared to the other 
                      two iterations, iteration 2 and iteration 3.   </p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <h3>Are there any particular design smells, or brilliant design decisions?</h3>
                    <p>At first, there were some design smells in the code as we were still learning about the design patterns 
                      and SOLID principles. As we understood the concept, we went back into fixing the code, tidying up the UI 
                      and doing some refactoring. We even went further into re-organizing the file structure (classes and files)
                       into a neatly ordered manner and that was our most brilliant design decision. </p>

                    <h3>Are there any outstanding bugs? </h3>
                    <p>The short answer to that is, no. We have thoroughly tested the app from the beginning with unit tests 
                      using JUnit.  In iteration 2, we made sure that the app was tested across bi-seams, logic layer and data 
                      layer using the integration tests to see how objects in our application integrated with each other. 
                      Furthermore, in iteration 3, we made sure we didn’t have any outstanding bugs by testing across all the 
                      seams, starting from the UI, to the logic layer and finally to the data layer. From the use of Mockito, 
                      by mocking the classes we have in our application, we made sure that the classes were functional and 
                      saving us from writing tests for each classes. Lastly, writing the acceptance tests, made sure that whichever
                       bug the user would see, they would be able to deal with it on their own as it serves as a means of damage 
                       control and minimize mistakes done by users. </p>

                    <h3>Did any features work better than expected?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely, the player statistics feature we created works very well with our application as we were a 
                      little bit overly ambitious in having a search bar included in the header. To our surprise, it integrated 
                      very well with the application, searching players using names as filters, narrowing down the lists. </p>

                    <h3>Are you using any technologies other than what was required? </h3>
                    <p>It’s something we didn’t chose to invest time in as we would have to inform ourselves about how these 
                      new tools work. Instead, we chose on cleaning up the code in the application, re-designing the UI wherever
                      possible and re-organizing the files and code structure. </p>

                    <h3>Are you using any specific technique covered in the course ? </h3>
                    <p>Not quite, but with certainly used all the testing approaches required for the iterations. We haven’t had
                       an opportunity to write any mobile applications using the TDD approach and this could have been a careless 
                       technical debt if we decided to use TDD as means of testing as we would be doing mostly experiments rather 
                       than actual coding, which could have potentially lead to incomplete features during iterations.  </p>

                    <h3>How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted? </h3>
                    <p>It certainly changed as our project velocity improved over the next iterations. Whilst, writing the user stories, 
                      it seemed easy to implement but it was only until we started coding that we realized, it was a little bit more than 
                      expected. We improvised a little bit there and went with the minimum requirements of the submission sheet.   </p>
